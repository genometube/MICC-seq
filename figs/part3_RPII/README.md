### MICC-seq Identifies Transcription-Related Chromatin Stripes

Our analysis of stripe pattern origins revealed compelling findings. We found that 90.18% of stripes originate from TSS regions and 50% from enhancers. Additionally, 75.99% of stripes begin at GRO-seq hotspots and RNA polymerase II peaks, while 77.35% start from regions with active histone modifications (H3K4me3/1 or H3K27ac). In contrast, we observed minimal stripe association with repressive histone modifications (H3K36me3, H3K27me3, or H3K9me3). These results show that stripe formation primarily occurs at transcriptionally active sites, especially at TSS regions. Although stripes typically indicate loop extrusion processes, only 30% of stripe origins overlapped with cohesin and CTCFâ€”the conventional model components. This evidence suggests that stripes detected by MICC-seq correlate strongly with transcriptionally active sites rather than with the traditional CTCF/cohesin extrusion model.

Our data indicates that the observed stripes are associated with RNA polymerase II transcription activity. Previous research using CTCF ChIA-PET and RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET has shown the ability to identify specific stripes related to CTCF and RNA polymerase II, respectively. To validate our findings, we compared the extruded stripes in our data with chromatin movement footprints from RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET and CTCF ChIA-PET (Li et al., 2012; Tang et al., 2015). Both MICC-seq and ChIA-PET exhibited stripe patterns on the contact map, confirming the presence of loop extrusion processes (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 4). Importantly, the stripe distribution in MICC-seq showed greater similarity to RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET than to CTCF ChIA-PET (Fig. 2A, Supplementary Fig. 4). Comprehensive analysis revealed that over 83% of the RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET stripe patterns were detectable in the MICC-seq data, while only 37% of the CTCF ChIA-PET patterns were visible (Fig. 2B). In our contact recovery analysis, MICC-seq recovered 98% of TSS-anchored contacts from RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET, but only 30% of contacts from CTCF. This observation aligns with previous findings that approximately 35% of CTCF peaks overlap with accessible chromatin regions{Chai, 2023 #873}. Notably, MICC-seq not only captured the majority of RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET stripes but also detected ten times more stripes (Fig. 2B). Additionally, the stripe length in MICC-seq was ten times greater than in RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET. These findings suggest that MICC-seq offers enhanced sensitivity for transcription stripe detection compared to RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET methodology.

We subsequently conducted a comparative analysis of the sensitivity between these two technologies across varying levels of transcriptional activity, from high to low expression genes. Our analysis revealed that RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET detected only 20%, 25%, and 8% of stripes on high, medium, and low expression TSS, respectively. In contrast, MICC-seq demonstrated superior detection capabilities, identifying 60%, 50%, and 45% of stripes from high, medium, and low expression TSS. These findings indicate that MICC-seq offers enhanced sensitivity, particularly for detecting medium to low expression TSS. Furthermore, MICC-seq overlapped with 85% of RNA polymerase II peaks, whereas ChIA-PET overlapped with merely 5.8% of RNA polymerase peaks. This substantial difference in detection capability can be attributed to MICC-seq's methodology, which does not rely on immunoprecipitation technology.

In summary, our analysis indicates that MICC-seq stripe patterns correlate with active transcription markers. Our data suggests that MICC-seq may provide enhanced detection capability compared to RNA polymerase II ChIA-PET for identifying transcription-related chromatin interactions. This approach potentially allows for the detection of transcriptional activities across various expression levels, including medium to low expression genes that may be challenging to detect with current methodologies.
