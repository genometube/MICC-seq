### Transcription Loops Mediate Enhancer-Promoter Interactions

Our analysis demonstrates that 25% of stable loops form between promoters and enhancers, with these loops ranging from 2kb to 1mb in length. This finding suggests that enhancers exhibit functional properties comparable to promoters in generating loop extrusion stripes, particularly when they produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Examination of ENCODE enhancer profile data indicates that 60% of enhancers display H3K27ac epigenetic modifications. Within this subset, GRO-seq data verifies active transcription in 60% of instances. It is noteworthy that enhancers without transcriptional activity typically fail to establish transcription loops. We identified a robust positive correlation (PCC 0.9) between enhancer transcriptional activity and loop extrusion intensity, where increased transcription correlates with more distinct stripe formation. Transcriptionally active enhancers exhibited double the contact frequency with target promoters compared to their inactive counterparts at similar distances. Furthermore, active enhancers interact with a greater number of promoters than inactive enhancers. Expression analysis revealed that promoters connected to active enhancers demonstrated approximately 50% higher activity than those associated with inactive enhancers. This observation aligns with previous KAS-seq findings regarding the superior capacity of transcribing enhancers to amplify promoter expression.

Further investigation using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor essential for enhancer activity, showed a 30% decrease in transcriptional activity across 400 enhancers. Subsequent analysis of transcription loops on these enhancers revealed a significant 40% reduction in interaction density on stripes, with 30% of loops no longer detectable. Target promoter activity decreased by a corresponding 30%. These findings suggest that enhancer transcription plays a key role in facilitating loop extrusion processes that establish enhancer-promoter connections. An important question remains: how do eRNAs transcription, despite their short length, potentially drive loop extrusion toward promoters? This presents an intriguing area for future research.
