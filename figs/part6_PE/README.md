### Transcription Loops Mediate Enhancer-Promoter Interactions

<<<<<<< HEAD
There is a long standing questions how the enhancer promoter specificity established in crowed regulatory neighborhoods. Our above analysis demonstrates that 20% the stripe initiated from the enhancer and finally formed the stable loops with paused TSS like above paused TSS- paused TSS loops, with these loops ranging from 2kb to 1mb in length. what drive the this finding process. 
(p-p p-e e-e interaction pct, loop span length)

 If the transcription is the driving power of the loops extrusion, we guessing if the enhancer transcription initiated and drived the loop extrusion until meet the partnered promoters. Examination of ENCODE enhancer profile data indicates that 2793 enhancers display H3K27ac epigenetic modifications and 2784 enhancers display H3K4me1 peaks. Within this subset, GRO-seq data verifies active transcription in 60% of instances. (h3k27ac,h3k4me1,gro seq eRNA, 3-type of enhancers)

 It is noteworthy that 80% enhancers with eRNA expression peaks overlapped with the loop extrusion initiation. 80% enhancers without eRNA expression peaks without typically fail to establish transcription loops. We identified a robust positive correlation (PCC 0.9) between enhancer transcriptional activity and loop extrusion intensity, where increased eRNA transcription correlates with more dense stripe formation. (GRO-seq enhancer vs Micc1D)

The enhancer initiated the loop extrusion, generally have the 2x higher eRNA expression, 4x higher H3K27ac. Transcriptionally active enhancers exhibited double the contact frequency with target promoters compared to their inactive counterparts at similar distances. 
Furthermore, active enhancers interact with a greater number of promoters than inactive enhancers. Expression analysis revealed that promoters connected to active enhancers demonstrated approximately 50% higher activity than those associated with inactive enhancers. This observation aligns with previous KAS-seq findings regarding the superior capacity of transcribing enhancers to amplify promoter expression. (contact promoter signal) 

Further investigation using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor essential for enhancer activity, showed a 30% decrease in transcriptional activity across 400 enhancers. Subsequent analysis of transcription loops on these enhancers revealed a significant 40% reduction in interaction density on stripes, with 30% of loops no longer detectable. Target promoter activity decreased by a corresponding 30%. These findings suggest that enhancer transcription plays a key role in facilitating loop extrusion processes that establish enhancer- paused promoter specific connection. 

The same as the promoter loop extrusion, the enhancer loop extrusion also 95% demonstrated the bidirectional loop extrusion, which is cordinated with eRNA transcription. Amoung that 30% divergent extrusion enhancer overlaped with the CTCF, conflict with previous researches, which need to be further discussed. (also check ctcf chip peak region)

(E-E pct, E-P pct, P-P pct; stable loop, loop span, loop span, loop boundary, gene number/enhancer/promoter, first loop near the line; interaction, h3k27ac; other if paused signal poised, h3k4me1, NIBPL, H3K36me3, pausing, promoter-enhancer promoter NIBPL motif KO)
The other important questions, how the enhancer transcription loop extrusion stopped the extrusion extesion to establised the specificity of the enhancer promoter interaction. We found 20% enhancer established the stable interaction with promoters, only 10% stable loop established with enhancer and enhancers. The average enhancer-promoter loop size is 1MB. Generally the 5-6 intermediate enhancers distributed inside the loops with >50kb size. The longer loops contain more intermidiate enhancers. Also the enhancer loops contained 2-3 genes inside the loops. But these genes only 1% were coding genes. Finally, the loop extrusion will stopped in the first genes with pausing signal that is the targeted genes, which is similar as the promoter promoter interactions. Compare the loop inside genes with the loop boundary genes, which established the stable connection with the enhancers, the targeted loop boundary genes have the H3K27ac modification and NIBPL loading, the inside intermidiate genes have the higher H3K36me3 modification without H3k27ac. Therefore how the enhancer find the right promoter, it used the loop extrusion scan the genome until met the first pausing genes. Also, the loop inside intermediate enhancers generally have the H3K4me1 modificaiton which be recognized as the bivalence enhancers. But this pass through just happened without recruiting and activated the significant eRNA expression. 

An important question remains: how do eRNAs transcription, despite their short length, potentially drive loop extrusion toward promoters? What is the function of the enhancers without eRNAs. This presents an intriguing area for future research.

(E-E stable loop: multiple line interaction, h3k27ac; other if paused signal poised, h3k4me1) The other important questions, how the multiple enhancer works. We found only 10% stable loop established with enhancer and enhancers. We found the enhancers based loop extrusion will passed though 3-5 enhancers with H3K4me1 high mark and low H3K27ac until met the stopper. see if it stop by ehnahcers with the higher interaction frequency. But this pass through just happened without recruiting and activated the significant eRNA expression. We also analyzed if the primary enhancer loop extrusion rest on the these enhancers, we found not significant. Only 10% loop extrusion will also stop on the other active enhancers and formed the stable loop might forming the enhancer hubs. These enhancers generally have eRNA expression and NIBPL loading which is similar phenomia we found in the promoter loop extrusion. The multiple enhancer hubs we found is composite from 2-5 enhancers, 90% of them just 2-3 enhancers. Again we can not confirm the multiple enhancer existence without single molecular or single cell resultion. scATAC-seq and SCA-seq confirmed the 60% of multiple enhancer recruitment hub existence. The multiple enhancer hubs generally have higher BRD4, Mediator accumulation. We compared the multiple enhancer recruited enhancer hubs with the single enhancer activted genes, we found the activated genes were 2x higher expression. 

An important question remains: how do eRNAs transcription, despite their short length, potentially drive loop extrusion toward promoters? What is the function of the enhancers without eRNAs. This presents an intriguing area for future research.

Our analysis demonstrates that 25% of stable loops form between promoters and enhancers, with these loops ranging from 2kb to 1mb in length. This finding suggests that enhancers exhibit functional properties comparable to promoters in generating loop extrusion stripes, particularly when they produce enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). Examination of ENCODE enhancer profile data indicates that 60% of enhancers display H3K27ac epigenetic modifications. Within this subset, GRO-seq data verifies active transcription in 60% of instances. It is noteworthy that enhancers without transcriptional activity typically fail to establish transcription loops.
