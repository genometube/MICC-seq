### V shape of the transcription loops extrusion

Recent studies have demonstrated that replication-based chromatin exhibits bidirectional movement, extending vertically from diagonal lines on contact maps. Previous research proposed that transcription progresses unidirectionally toward the transcription end site (TES), with the TSS anchored, creating a 45-degree angle with the diagonal line in chromatin contact maps{Zheng, 2019 #265}. However, GRO-seq analyses have revealed that transcription at the TSS predominantly occurs bidirectionally{Core, 2008 #885}, which theoretically should result in bidirectional loop extrusion. Our findings indicate that 95% of TSS exhibit bidirectional transcription loops rather than unidirectional patterns, extending in both directions from the TSS and forming a distinctive V-shaped pattern. Among these TSS with bidirectional transcription loops, 95% demonstrate detectable divergent transcription in PRO-seq data. Genome-wide analysis shows that promoters with divergent nascent transcription consistently display the most pronounced MICC bidirectional stripes. When we compared loop extrusion strength between the positive direction (TSS to TES) and reverse direction (TSS backward), we found that the positive direction loop extrusion density is 2× greater than the reverse direction, mirroring the pattern of divergent transcription. Additionally, previous investigations have established that genes with strong divergent initiation correlate with nucleosome-depleted regions flanked by phased −1/+1 nucleosomes{Core, 2014 #1630}. This observation supports a unified promoter architecture model where bidirectional initiation and stable NDR co-occur, phenomena strongly correlated with V-shaped bidirectional loop extrusion.

The second consideration pertains to the extent of transcription loops and stable loop formation. Our observations indicate that transcription loops continue until they establish stable loops, which appear as dark dots in chromatin contact maps. Through MICC-seq analysis, we identified 48,070 loops globally with an average size of 70kb. We analyzed the gene distribution on these loops, finding 4,560 genes inside the loops and 2,000 genes on the loop boundaries. Examination of loop anchor points revealed that 70% of loops form between TSS regions, 25% between TSS and enhancers, and only 5% between TSS and transcription end sites. The loop size distribuiton upper quantile 5Mb lower quantile 10kb. This evidence suggests Our data indicates that transcription loops typically formed the stable loops with another TSS, which align previous findings in Micro-C. 

We first analysis the sequence bias between the loop boundary TSS and loop internal TSS, the boundary TSS are CG enrich and TATA less promoters, which were frequently bidirecitonal and showed pronounced pausing. Our comparative epigenetic analysis determined that genes located at loop boundaries demonstrate significantly higher expression levels and enhanced H3K4me3 signals at their TSS compared to internal genes. In contrast, the internal genes’ TSS have higher H3K36me3 signal than the boundary TSS, indicating the productive elongation. The boundary TSS 80% overlapped with pausing gene yet active genes. Most non-pausing genes is inside the loop not loop boundary. GRO-seq analysis further revealed that boundary genes exhibit a notably 4x higher pausing index at their TSS compared to genes within loops. Conversely, genes with pausing signals (paused yet active transcription) show approximately 10-fold stronger stripe boundary signals than those without pausing. Analysis of NELF, a well-established transcription pausing factor, confirmed that boundary genes display signal intensity three times greater than internal genes, providing additional validation for our observations. The MICC offered a 3D mapping of the location of the pausing and non-pausing genes, established an interesting hypothesis that, the pausing genes waiting to exstablished the loop extrusion, after start extrusion, gradually move tward and slip through the non-pausing genes, until met the next pausing signal. 

To further examine the relationship between boundary gene transcription, loop formation, and downstream gene effects, we conducted a dCas9-KRAB experiment targeting the FZD1 promoter located at a loop boundary. Results demonstrated that inhibiting FZD1 transcription disrupted the associated transcription stripes, providing evidence that loop extrusion requires active transcription. Following loop disruption, we observed significant downregulation not only of FZD1 expression but also of AKAP9 and CYP51A1—genes positioned within the loop in proximity to FZD1 (Fig3C, Fig5E). These results suggest that transcription loop extrusion may play a role in regulating gene expression within the loop's path. These findings indicate that transcription loop formation is dependent on boundary gene activity and subsequently affects the expression of genes encountered during the extrusion process.

Our research demonstrates that transcription loops form primarily in a bidirectional, V-shaped pattern originating from the TSS, contradicting previous unidirectional models. These loops generally terminate when they encounter another TSS rather than at the TES. Transcription pausing plays a crucial role in loop formation, with these structures functioning as fundamental regulatory units that coordinate gene expression within their boundaries.
