### V shape of the transcription loops extrusion

Recent studies have demonstrated that replication-based chromatin exhibits fountain shape, extending vertically from diagonal lines on contact maps. Previous research proposed that transcription progresses unidirectionally toward the transcription end site (TES), with the TSS anchored, creating a 45-degree angle with the diagonal line in chromatin contact maps{Zheng, 2019 #265}. However, GRO-seq analyses have revealed that transcription at the TSS predominantly occurs bidirectionally{Core, 2008 #885}, which theoretically should result in bidirectional loop extrusion. Our findings indicate that 95% of TSS exhibit bidirectional transcription loops rather than unidirectional patterns, extending in both directions from the TSS and forming a distinctive V-shaped pattern. Among these anchored TSS with bidirectional transcription loops, 95% demonstrate detectable divergent transcription in PRO-seq data. Genome-wide analysis shows that promoters with divergent nascent transcription consistently display the most pronounced MICC bidirectional stripes. When we compared loop extrusion strength between the positive direction (TSS to TES) and reverse direction (TSS backward), we found that the positive direction loop extrusion density is 2× greater than the reverse direction, mirroring the pattern of divergent transcription. Additionally, previous investigations have established that genes with strong divergent initiation correlate with nucleosome-depleted regions flanked by phased −1/+1 nucleosomes{Core, 2014 #1630}. This observation supports a unified promoter architecture model where bidirectional initiation and stable NDR co-occur, phenomena strongly correlated with V-shaped bidirectional loop extrusion. Moreover, we found the 30% of the divergent TSS stripes overlapped with the CTCF but the CTCF did not affect the diretionality of the transcription loops, which need further disscussed.

### Transcription Loop Extrusion Pausing

The V-shaped loop extrusion continues to probe the genome bidirectionally. A key question addresses where this process terminates. The termination point presents as a stable loop between two anchors, visualized as dark dots in chromatin contact maps. Our MICC-seq analysis identified 48,070 loops globally averaging 70kb in size, which exceeds previously documented dimensions.

Examination of stable loop anchor points revealed that 70% of loops form between promoter regions, 25% between promoter and enhancers, and only 5% between promoter and terminator. Our findings indicate that stable loops predominantly form between promoter-promoter interactions rather than enhancer-promoter loops, contrary to expectations.

Regarding loop size distribution, enhancer-promoter loops exhibited the largest dimensions, followed by promoter-promoter loops, with promoter-terminator loops being the smallest. Analysis of extrusion pausing events demonstrated that pausing events constitute only 20% of loop searching activities, suggesting that stable loops represent relatively infrequent occurrences while genome searching movements predominate. This observation aligns with recent literature indicating that genomic searching movement represents the primary activity within the genome.

Interestingly, loop pausing frequency is highest in enhancer-promoter interactions and lowest in promoter-promoter interactions, suggesting the enhancer-promoter interaction stability. Additionally, we observed that each enhancer/promoter-initiated transcription loop extrusion pauses with approximately 4-5 partners on average, indicating a many-to-many rather than one-to-one partnership model. This phenomenon lends support to the concept of transcription hubs where promoters/enhancers interconnect, although population-level MICC data cannot definitively determine whether multiple loops form simultaneously or sequentially.

Further analysis of contact frequency among sequential partners revealed that the first partner demonstrated interaction frequency two times higher than subsequent partners. This indicates preferential anchoring to nearest partners, consistent with previous research suggesting that promoters possess enhancer-like functions in activating partner promoters.


### Transcription Loops Mediate Promoter-Promoter Interactions

Our analysis of gene distribution identified 4,560 genes within these loops and 2,000 genes positioned at loop anchors. This indicates that only 30% of promoter-promoter interactions are anchored on stable loop boundaries, while the remaining genes reside within the loops where loop extrusion processes traverse them. This distribution raises fundamental questions regarding the distinguishing characteristics between anchor genes and pathway genes.

Our initial sequence analysis revealed that loop anchored TSS regions are characterized by CG-enriched, TATA-less promoters, which frequently exhibit bidirectional activity and pronounced transcriptional pausing. Comparative epigenetic profiling demonstrated that genes located at loop anchors exhibit significantly elevated expression levels and enhanced H3K4me3 signals at their TSS compared to pathway genes. Conversely, pathway genes' TSS regions display higher H3K36me3 signals than anchored TSS, indicating active elongation processes.

Notably, 70% of anchored genes demonstrated detectable pausing signals in GRO-seq data. Correspondingly, 98% of genes with pausing characteristics were positioned at loop anchors, while most non-pausing genes were located within loops as pathway genes. Further GRO-seq analysis revealed that anchored genes exhibit approximately 4x higher pausing indices at their TSS compared to pathway genes. Additionally, genes with pausing signals (indicating paused yet active transcription) displayed approximately 10-fold stronger stripe boundary signals than those without pausing characteristics.

Our analysis of NELF, a well-established transcription pausing factor, confirmed that boundary genes exhibit signal intensity three times greater than internal genes, providing additional validation for these observations. As previously noted, loop initiation anchors typically demonstrate divergent transcription patterns, which aligns with established research indicating that pausing genes frequently exhibit strong divergent transcription signals. These complementary lines of evidence mutually reinforce our findings that loop anchors typically consist of pausing genes with divergent transcription characteristics.

The MICC methodology provides a three-dimensional mapping of pausing and non-pausing gene locations, addressing longstanding questions regarding their spatial distribution and relationships. This data supports an intriguing hypothesis: pausing genes establish loop extrusion processes that subsequently progress through non-pausing genes until encountering the next pausing signal.

To further examine the relationship between boundary gene transcription, loop formation, and downstream gene effects, we conducted a dCas9-KRAB experiment targeting the FZD1 promoter located at a loop boundary. Results demonstrated that inhibiting FZD1 transcription disrupted the associated transcription stripes, providing evidence that loop extrusion requires active transcription. Following loop disruption, we observed significant downregulation not only of FZD1 expression but also of AKAP9 and CYP51A1—genes positioned within the loop in proximity to FZD1 (Fig3C, Fig5E). These results suggest that transcription loop extrusion may play a role in regulating gene expression within the loop's path. These findings indicate that transcription loop formation is dependent on anchored gene activity and lighten the expression of genes encountered during the extrusion process pass through.

Our research demonstrates that transcription loops form primarily in a bidirectional, V-shaped pattern originating from the TSS, contradicting previous unidirectional models. These loops generally terminate when they encounter another paused TSS rather than at the TES. Transcription pausing plays a crucial role in loop formation, with these structures functioning as fundamental regulatory units that coordinate gene expression within their boundaries.


### Transcription Loops Mediate Enhancer-Promoter Interactions

There is a long standing questions how the enhancer promoter specificity established in crowed regulatory neighborhoods. Our above analysis demonstrates that 20% the stripe initiated from the enhancer and finally formed the stable loops with paused TSS like above paused TSS- paused TSS loops, with these loops ranging from 2kb to 1mb in length. what drive the this finding process. If the transcription is the driving power of the loops extrusion, we guessing if the enhancer transcription initiated and drived the loop extrusion until meet the partnered promoters. Examination of ENCODE enhancer profile data indicates that 2793 enhancers display H3K27ac epigenetic modifications and 2784 enhancers display H3K4me1 peaks. GRO-seq data verifies active transcription in 60% of enhancers, most of them overlapped with H3K27ac. It is noteworthy that 80% enhancers with eRNA expression peaks overlapped with the loop extrusion initiation. 80% enhancers without eRNA expression peaks typically fail to establish transcription loops. We identified a robust positive correlation (PCC 0.9) between enhancer transcriptional activity and loop extrusion intensity, where increased eRNA transcription correlates with more dense stripe formation. The enhancer initiated the loop extrusion, generally have the 2x higher eRNA expression, 4x higher H3K27ac. Transcriptionally active enhancers exhibited double the contact frequency with target promoters compared to their inactive counterparts at similar distances.  Expression analysis revealed that promoters connected to active enhancers demonstrated approximately 50% higher activity than those associated with inactive enhancers. This observation aligns with previous KAS-seq findings regarding the superior capacity of transcribing enhancers to amplify promoter expression. 

The secondary enhancer H3K4me1 markers usually on the pathway of the loop extrusion. The primary enhancers with loop extrusion searching traverse the secondary enhancers. We analyze the event frequency between the primary enhancer and secondary enhancer. We did not find the primary enhancer have the significant rest on the secondary enhancers, it just like the baton in the loop extrusion pathway. Moreover, the active enhancer also passed the genes without pausing signal, these genes were pathway genes have the H3K36me3 signals, with weaker expression. The further analysis found the active enhancer did not rest on the promoter very long time no difference in the searching pathway. It is like a transient acitivation. The active enhancers will rest on the first paused promoters as previous statement, but not only one partner, average 4-5 promoter interaction after first paused promoter. That actually make sense that promoter-promoter actually have a lot, if enhancer touch one promoter, like cascade, it will also touch many other promoter in the network. Then we compare the frequency between the first promoter and the later one to see if there is any frequency difference. Most of them did not show the difference indicated that the enhancer have no prefericial to choose the nearest promoter. These model very well mix the two models in the enhancer-promoter activation: Some pathway genes were transient activation by just traversing on that, some pausing gene have stable connection with active enhancers as the longer activation.

Further investigation using JQ1, a BRD4 inhibitor essential for enhancer activity, showed a 30% decrease in transcriptional activity across 400 enhancers. Subsequent analysis of transcription loops on these enhancers revealed a significant 40% reduction in interaction density on stripes, with 30% of loops no longer detectable. Target promoter activity decreased by a corresponding 30%. These findings suggest that enhancer transcription plays a key role in facilitating loop extrusion processes that establish enhancer- paused promoter specific connection. Also in ehnacer the bidirection searching activity, we found the positive searching and negative searching event frequency is equal, that is also a difference between promoter-promoter loops. Also by comparing the forward and backward, the pausing events also showed similar, that means the stability of enhancer between forward searching and backward searching is similar.

The second question is that if the enhancer could activated the further genes by pass the first pausing genes. Yes. We found the enhancers could formed the first loop with the first pausing genes. most likely rely on the Promoter promoter interaction continue to recruit the second promoter to the primary hub. Therefore offered the chance to activate the second gene promoter. But the second loop is coestablished with the primary loops or the formed in sequencial is another question need the single cell resolution to explore.

An important question remains: how do eRNAs transcription, despite their short length, potentially drive loop extrusion toward promoters? What is the function of the enhancers without eRNAs. This presents an intriguing area for future research.
