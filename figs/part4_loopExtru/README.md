### Transcription Loop Extrusion Are Highly Correlated with Transcriptional Activity

Our investigation explored the relationship between stripe patterns and transcriptional activity. Research has established that RNA polymerase II generates supercoiled force driving genome extrusion toward transcription sites (Zheng, 2019). Based on this mechanism, we proposed that transcriptional activity levels would directly correlate with stripe density. To test this hypothesis, we selected two examples: genes with high nascent RNA transcription (top 25%) and genes with low transcription activity (bottom 25%). In GRO-seq analysis, high-transcription genes showed 3× higher signal than low-transcription genes. Similarly, high-transcription genes exhibited 4× more TSS-anchored contact signal than low-transcription genes. In our global analysis, we classified genes into high, medium, and low expression categories and quantified chromatin interaction density within the stripes. This analysis revealed that average chromatin interaction density correlates positively with expression levels (cor: 0.92). Through Aggregate Peak Analysis (APA) of genes categorized by expression, we confirmed a significant positive correlation: highly expressed genes exhibited more pronounced stripe patterns, with 4× more loop extrusion signal (0.69 vs 0.23). Additionally, the overall interaction density for individual genes demonstrated strong positive correlation with nascent transcription signals (GRO-seq, PCC 0.7). These findings indicate that elevated RNA polymerase activity facilitates increased interactions with transcription start sites (TSSs), resulting in higher-density stripe formations.

We performed a comparative analysis of extrusion interactions with TSS (utilizing aggregated 4C) against GRO-seq data. Our findings demonstrated a significant correlation between nascent RNA production and conformational changes in DNA structure. Notably, we observed higher frequency of extruding interactions proximal to the TSS, which gradually diminished toward transcription termination sites. This pattern corresponds directly with the progressive reduction in transcription observed in the same direction. These observations suggest the similar pace pattern between RNA polymerase II frequency and TSS-associated interactions. 

To assess the more direct relationship between active transcription and loop extrusions, we utilized triptolide and DRB, established transcriptional inhibitors that specifically target transcription initiation and positive transcription elongation factors. Administration of these compounds resulted in a 95% reduction in gene expression, consistent with their known mechanism of action. Upon examination following a 3-hour treatment period, we observed that approximately 95% of the previously detected extruded stripes were no longer present, indicating that the majority of loop extrusion stripes identified via MICC-seq methodology are contingent upon active transcriptional processes. Comparing the triptolide and DRB effects, we found that DRB had a stronger effect on inhibiting loop extension, resulting in 10× more stripes disappearing and shorten the loop length. Additionally, DRB showed 50% stronger effects in reducing loop extension over longer distances (distance decay curve), while triptolide had more pronounced effects on contacts close to the TSS sites. These results align with previous publications showing that triptolide inhibits transcription initiation while DRB affects elongation, suggesting that polymerase elongation has stronger power to drive loop extrusion. These findings provide additional evidence supporting the hypothesis that polymerase elongation activity constitutes the primary mechanism facilitating the extrusion of transcription loops detected through MICC-seq analysis.

In conclusion, our analysis indicates that these stripe formations are strongly associated with transcriptional activity, providing evidence that transcription serves as a primary driver of loop extrusion in this context.
